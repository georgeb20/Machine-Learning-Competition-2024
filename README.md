Download fracture_identification folder from the git repo (type in "git lfs clone https://github.com/pddasig/Machine-Learning-Competition-2024.git" in your command prompt) and put it into your google drive (/content/gdrive/My Drive/fracture_identification/). 
Then you can run a draft notebook "2024_PDDA_ML_competition.ipynb" for fracture detections.
If you have any questions or need clarifications, send an email to "pdda_sig@spwla.org". Thank you!

Note: We will update this README for answering questions and sharing information, stay tuned!

**UPDATES:**
1. For the submission, it seems like the Codalab bug is caused by the deprecation of mutation events in Chrome (probably Edge and Explorer too). It still runs on Firefox so participants are recommended to submit using Firefox.
